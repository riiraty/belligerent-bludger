## Week 1

#### Progress

Went through the course material pretty thoroughly. Created the repository for my project. All the foundation work for the documentation is done. Discussed at lenght with an instructor about my topic options. Eventually chose a topic(RSA). The [Requirements document](https://github.com/riiraty/belligerent-bludger/blob/master/documentation/requirements-document.md) is done. The project is set up and has some configurations for testing. There is some dummy-code and on dummy-test I made to test the configurations.

After researching the topic, I have a good grasp how it works in theory, but need to figure out how to actually make it work.

#### Problems

Had a hard time trying to decide on the topic, and wasted time researching the option I would drop. Did not therefore have time to figure out the required math and complexity estimates for the design document. 

I don't have a clear plan on how to start the actual project and I need to make some decisions about implementing some steps. I don't yet know how to design the structure for the program.
